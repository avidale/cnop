## What does it do
Read the paper: `paper/Estimation of nested and zero-inflated ordered probit models.pdf`

Or read [the published preprint](https://www.hse.ru/data/2018/05/30/1149326878/193EC2018.pdf).

## How to try it
1. Copy the contents of `package` folders to your personal Stata directory (probably it is `C:\ado\personal` - check by typing `sysdir` in Stata.
2. In, Stata, `cd` to the `{repository root}\application` directory. 
3. Now you can execute `application.do` line by line and see what happens.

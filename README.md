Cross-nested ordered probit statistical models implementation in Stata

## What does it do
Read the paper: `paper/Estimation of nested and zero-inflated ordered probit models.pdf`

Or read [the published version](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X211000002).

If you understand Russian, you can read [a Habr blogpost about the model](https://habr.com/ru/post/548100) with a simplified Python implementation.

## How to try it
1. Copy the contents of `package` folders to your personal Stata directory (probably it is `C:\ado\personal` - check by typing `sysdir` in Stata.
2. In, Stata, `cd` to the `{repository root}\application` directory. 
3. Now you can execute `application.do` line by line and see what happens.
